# Next Steps

- If you run the command without a name, open a fuzzy finder that looks at:
    - names, url
- have a hierarchy of names
    - can we have a group of names that are "work" names?
    - or "personal" names?
- choose which browser to open the URL with
    - Make a patch on the browser package that allows you to choose which browser to open
    - Which browsers?
        - Safari
        - Firefox
        - Chrome
- choose other launch arguments that we might use with a particular browser
    - Make a patch on the browser package that allows you to specify browser launch arguments
    - What arguments?
        - Let's see what options we have when we launch Chrome and work from there
- add tags?
